# E-commerce Project (Simple)

Here is a e-commerce page. 
Here, an fake api is used to show different products to the user. 
User can't add products to the cart without login.
Initially, sigh up & login designs are given, no credential or logic is here. Users can add product to the cart, can view their card, can add or remove product from the cart. A lot of functionalities can be added here, like admin dashboard, which is not present here yet.
